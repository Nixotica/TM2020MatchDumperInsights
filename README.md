# TM2020 Match Dumper

Super naive Openplanet Plugin to dump match times into a CSV file.

Simply pick a filename, and start recording as the match is played.

Every record in the dump has a timestamp, the track name, the player ID, the player username, and the time set in milliseconds.

The files are stored in Openplanet's plugin storage folder, so by default 

```
C:\Users\<user>\OpenplanetNext\PluginStorage\TM2020MatchDumper
```
